== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Why was this plugin created?**

In my day to day work cleaning malware from hacked websites, I find hackers often gain access by signing in through a stolen or guessed at Administrator account password.

Many of the established security plugins include Administrator login notification as well. But these other plugins tend to be bloated, with lots of extraneous features and complicated setup requirements.

Why make it so hard–geez!

This has left me with a choice. Either I recommend clients install one of those 100+ feature plugins, which include notification as an extra feature, or I eliminate all frustration and create a 1-click to install notification plugin for my clients.

So The Hack Repair Guy's Admin Login Notifier plugin was born.

**1. If I deactivate or remove the plugin what will happen?**

Short answer: No alerts will be sent.

Long answer: Deactivation is the recommended way to turn off notifications as well.

**2. What if I wish to change the notification email address?**

Short answer: Change the setting in `WP Admin > Settings > General > Email Address`.

Long answer: The Hack Repair Guy's Admin Login Notifier uses WordPress' default admin email setting - this notification will be sent to the same email address WordPress uses to send you other notifications. 

Additional notification recipients may be selected via the plugin Settings page. Just select which users should be notified and click Save. 

**3. Why did you create this plugin?**

Short answer: I tire of  complicated plugins.

Long answer: Most login notification plugins require several steps to fully configure. I've solved that "problem" with The Hack Repair Guy's Admin Login Notifier. Time is precious–and and I've got none to spare!
